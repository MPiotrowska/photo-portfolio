          Monika was simply wonderful! It was our first time in London and we
          wanted to have some family pictures taken with the famous London
          Landmarks. Our session was just fabulous! Our kids warmed up to Monika
          right away! I canâ€™t say enough about her friendliness and her eye for
          the camera. We not only have wonderful memories of London now but we
          also now have priceless photos of our family that we will be looking
          at forever and ever. I am recommending her to everyone I know and you
          will as well!
